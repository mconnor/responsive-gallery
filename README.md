# responsive-gallery
A responsive photo gallery using Jquery and [Fancy Box]
[fancybox].

In began this in 2013

This is from a a tutorial Lynda.com. I cleaned things up a bit.  I went back to see what my early js looked like.  I was horrified so i decided to clean things up a bit - and start moving all work to github for posterity sake.

The js is now in a immediately-invoked function expression function.
- Set up a jshint
- added package.jason
- Jquery in node_modules

Todo
- move photos off of github
- pull photos in via json
