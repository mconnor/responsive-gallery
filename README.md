# responsive-gallery
A responsive photo gallery using Jquery and Fancy Box.

This started as a tutorial on Lynda.com. I cleaned things up a bit.

The js is now in a immediately-invoked function expression function.
- Set up a jshint
- added package.jason
- Jquery in node_modules

Todo
- move photos off of github
- pull photos in via json
